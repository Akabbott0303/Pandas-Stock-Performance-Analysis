# Pandas Homework

This code was written as a homework assignment for FinTech Bootcamp.  I start off by importing several CSV files containing history stock data.  I use Pandas to create dataframes for each CSV file and then concatenate them so that I can analyze them to see how well they perform.  In the second part of the assignment, I create my own portfolio and run through the same process.
